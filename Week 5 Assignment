# Set Up
1. Load the tidyverse library.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

2. Load the billboard data. 
```{r}
data("billboard")
```

3. What type of data is this? (e.g. describe what's in the dataset.)
These are song ratings for Billboard top 100 in the year 2000

4. Print the column names from this dataset.
```{r}
colnames(billboard)
```

5. Print the first 5 entries in the dataset. 
```{r}
head(billboard, 5)
```


# Practice
1. Create a subset of data that has Jay-Z as the only artist. How many songs are in it?
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
```{r}
billboard %>% filter(artist == "Jay-Z")
```
There are 5 songs in the subset.

2. In the original dataset, use filter to find information about the song "All the small things." What was the highest position this song reached on the billboard 100? 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
```{r}
billboard %>% filter(track == "All The Small Things")
```
The highest position of this song on Billboard 100 was 35.

3. Create a subset of data for songs Tim McGraw sang. Summarize the data for wk 1.
```{r}
subset(billboard, artist == "McGraw, Tim")
```
```{r}
summary(billboard$wk1)
```
